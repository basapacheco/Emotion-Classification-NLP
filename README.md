# Emotion Classification NLP

## Overview

This project aims to classify emotions using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It is presented in both Spanish and English to accommodate a diverse audience.

## Context

Identifying emotions is crucial in numerous data science and NLP projects. This dataset enables the training of robust models and emotional analysis.

## File Description

- **Clasificador de Emociones.ipynb**: Notebook containing the complete project in Spanish.
- **Emotion Classification.ipynb**: Notebook containing the complete project in English.

Both files represent the same project, one in Spanish and the other in English, allowing you to choose your preferred language.

## Workflow

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Processing data using libraries like numpy and pandas to prepare it for analysis.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Conducting sentiment analysis to understand polarity and subjectivity of texts in relation to emotions.
3. **Modeling and Evaluation**: Testing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc., to classify emotions based on the prepared data.
4. **Model Optimization**: Exploring techniques like word reduction and count vectorizer to enhance model performance.
5. **Results**: Achieving an 82% accuracy with the Logistic Regression model using count vectorizer.

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, the following libraries are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- spacy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- textblob (for sentiment analysis)
- keras/tensorflow (for neural networks)

## Usage

To use this project, download the respective files and run them in your Jupyter Notebook environment or any Python-compatible environment.
